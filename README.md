# And what is Carla's objective?
Unlike languages that are simple to embed, such as C, Carla has a different objective. It aims to be complete, easily embedded, have EASY integration with all possible systems where the language can be embedded, and of course, direct community input within the language's code generation through [Morgana extensors](https://github.com/Carla-Corp/extensors).

### What does this mean?

- Carla has an extensive core, but a 100% independent code generator. This allows us to optimize Carla for all possible platforms, whether CPUs/GPUs or even MCUs.
- Carla uses Morgana as her machine code generator backend. This means: Much more creative freedom for the language! Without being tied to the constraints of LLVM and/or MLIR.
