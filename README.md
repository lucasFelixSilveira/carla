### About
Carla is a pattern created by a young programmer, who felt tired of languages ​​and their paradigms. Where, he was always very fond of fundamentalism and modernizing every little thing as much as possible. Inspired by the fundamentals of C, the beauty of Rust, and admired by the Heskell difference, he started the **Carla** project.

### Fundamentals  
- Practicality
- Modernity 
- Fundamentalism
- Mathematical ease
